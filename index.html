                    <h3>About Lael Wilcox</h3>
                    <p>Lael Wilcox is an ultra-endurance bicycle racer. Born on July 28, 1987, Lael only started riding at 20 years old as a way to commute. This soon turned into an 11-year journey around the world. Lael first became interested in racing in 2014 when she was in Israel and entered the Holyland Challenge, a 1000-mile unsupported race across the country. She was both the youngest rider and the only woman. She led the race by 25 miles the first day, and although she did not win the race, she was firmly focused on endurance racing.</p>

                    <h4>Why I made a tribute for Lael Wilcox?</h4>
                    <p>I made this tribute for Lael Wilcox because I admire her achievements in endurance racing, which is mostly a male dominated sport. Her endurance and her achievements are very inspiring and I hope to one day ride long distances like her.</p>
